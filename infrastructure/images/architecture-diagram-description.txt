# SalePoint Architecture Diagram Description

This is a description for creating the architecture diagram:

1. Create a diagram with the following AWS services and their connections:

## Frontend Layer:
- Web Browser clients connecting to CloudFront
- CloudFront distribution connected to S3 (for static assets) and API Gateway (for API calls)

## Authentication Layer:
- Amazon Cognito connected to API Gateway for user authentication
- IAM policies for service-to-service authentication

## API Layer:
- API Gateway in the center with multiple endpoints (Products, Customers, Sales, etc.)
- API Gateway connected to various Lambda functions

## Compute Layer:
- Lambda functions for:
  - Products API
  - Customers API
  - Sales API
  - Inventory Updates
  - Search functionality

## Data Layer:
- Amazon RDS (MySQL) database for structured data (products, sales, inventory)
- Amazon DynamoDB for customer relationship data
- Amazon S3 for product images and documents

## Analytics Layer:
- Amazon QuickSight connected to RDS for dashboards and reporting
- CloudWatch for monitoring and logging

## Arrows showing data flow:
1. User requests from browsers to CloudFront
2. Authentication flow through Cognito
3. API requests through API Gateway to Lambda
4. Lambda reading/writing to databases
5. Data retrieval from S3 for product images
6. Analytics queries from QuickSight to RDS

Use AWS official icons for all services.
Include a color key to distinguish between different service categories.
